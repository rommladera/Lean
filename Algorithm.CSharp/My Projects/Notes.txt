TODO:

-Add Quant properties
	-Winrate

-At the end of the day, log winner of Winrate and winner of TotalPerformance

-- Add plot lines so we can see who wins
	-Daily Performance





*-Match debug data to see if the same calculations
*-Plot Porfolio Performance
*-Plot Quant Performance, so you can match with Portfolio

	Plot data and debug are almost the same with very few discrepancy.  Don't know why price is slight slightly different.




-Debug show holdings, either beginning of day or eod or both
-Add LoggingOn property



-Check Momentum Values, where does daily open and close
	-Check files and see if you can find out (Files didn't work)
