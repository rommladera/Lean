TODO:

-Top Universe is different in Live vs  Backtest. Seems like .HasData removed some securities
	-Remove the .HasData and see the value




*****Historical data seems to be accurate between Live and Backtest...so calculate indicators manually using history
***Price seems to be more accurate starting one minute after opening.  Imeediately after opening is very inaccurate

- Update and Indicators seems to be wonky.

*- Record live data, so we can comapre with backtest (every minute)
*	- Record Indicator live value
*	- Record History data (top 5?)
	



-- Use VWAP B/S at 1, 2, 4, 8, 16

History Update is not working well, Check using actual absolute value to update/warm up indicator, and check SNOW

.HasData is not working well. Not all securities are included
